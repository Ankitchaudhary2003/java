1. The Genesis of Java
Java was created by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. 
Originally, it was developed for consumer electronic devices, but its platform-independent nature and object-oriented features made it suitable for internet programming.
Java officially debuted in 1995 with the release of JDK 1.0. Since then, it has become one of the most popular programming languages, known for its simplicity, robustness, and security.

2. Overview of Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity, platform independence, and security features.
It follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle, meaning that Java code can run on any device or platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
Key features of Java include automatic memory management (garbage collection), strong type system, exception handling, and support for multi-threading.
